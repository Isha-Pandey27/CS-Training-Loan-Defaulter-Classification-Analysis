# CS-Training-Loan-Defaulter-Classification-Analysis

This dataset has been taken from Kaggle, and is about the loan defaulter or not.

This is a Machine Learning Classification problem. Here we will predict whether the person asking for loan will default or not, with the use of certain independent features like RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines, age, DebtRatio, MonthlyIncome, NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans, NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines and NumberOfDependents.

We will first start with data cleaning and will proceed with Exploratory Data Analysis. Then we will build stats model and see accuracy. 
We will also use oversampling techique for handling imbalanced data. Then, will proceed with ML Random Forest Classifier for model building. We will tune the Hyper parameters to achieve the best accuracy.

Finally, will score the data, i.e. use our model to predict on unseen data and based on optimum threshold will recommend whether the Loan application should be accepted or rejected.
